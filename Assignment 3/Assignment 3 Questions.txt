Strings are immutable in Java. For example, in some programming languages, like C++, strings are mutable, which means we can change chars in the original string by finding the 
corresponding index, and then assign a new char value to it. However, in Java, Strings are objects, which means they have been protected and not be able to get modified.
If I have to manipulate a string in java, I will break the original string into parts, even into single characters, and after I finish dealing with single characters, I can combine 
these parts together, and make a new string to store the revised values.
